## Immediately Invoked Function Expression

**Definition**
An Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) is a function that is executed immediately after it is defined.

**Example**

```javascript
(
    function(){
        console.log("This is an IIFE");    
    }
)();

```

**Notes**

- Notice that the function is wrapped in parethesis. Also that parenthesis is appended with ``();`` to denote that a function is being called.
- While the IIFE is a concept popularized in JavaScript, it can also be used in other programming languages.
